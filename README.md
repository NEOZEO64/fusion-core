# FUSION CORE (synthesizer)

![](./img/Banner.png)

## Aims

- No aim lol
- Get to know delicious circuits (experimenting a lot)
- Use them in crude ways to generate sounds
- Learn how to design circuits & professionally manufacture them with KiCad
- Learn whats possible with analog circuits and what's not
- Have a lot of fun without the need of programming

- Get an overview of electronic parts out there
- Manage a big project
- Make ambient dub techno at the end lol

DIY dual 12V power supply + 5V (combined switched mode & linear regulated)
<img src="./img/PSU.jpg" width=60%>

My first module! Still very early, but reliable 1V/oct frequency control and all outputs (Triangle, Saw, Rectangle) have the same voltage levels

## Module Specifications
- Â±12V, 5V Power Supply
- 16cm high, n * 2cm wide (Eurorack is too small, Cosmo too large)

- PCB-Color: Green
- Different front-plate materials (wooden, metal, PVC)


# Level 1: Basic Synth

## Chapter 1: Case
- It should be a wooden box sprayed black with fancy neon art or something


## Chapter 2: PSU
- found a better one than my own diy thing (RT65-B)

## Chapter 3: 3x VCO 
- still experimenting and learning how to design modules with input / output protection
- but first VCO tests work based on AS3340/CEM3340
